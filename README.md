# IncrementalDeadCodeAnalysis

This is an analysis-plugin for the [IncrementalAnalysesInfrastructure](https://github.com/KernelHaven/IncrementalAnalysesInfrastructure) performing the DeadCodeAnalysis. This analysis does not work without the incremental infrastructure plugin.

Similar to UndeadAnalyzer, two variants of the analysis exist (a single-threaded and a multithreaded version):


## Usage

Place the jar-file downloaded from the releases section of this project into the plugins folder of KernelHaven.

`analysis.class` can be set to one of (depending on whether you want to run a multi-threaded or single-threaded version)

``
net.ssehub.kernel_haven.incremental.analysis.IncrementalDeadCodeAnalysis
net.ssehub.kernel_haven.incremental.analysis.IncrementalThreadedDeadCodeAnalysis
``

for the multithreaded-version, you can change the number of threads by including the folling line in your KernelHaven-configuration file:

``
analysis.undead.threads = 20
``
